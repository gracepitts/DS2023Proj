        "* ``Total Player Load``: Total physical effort during a session. This is important for our analysis to see how much work the athlete is doing overall. \n",
        "* ``Player Load Per Minute``: Effort per minute (intensity). This is important for our analysis to see the intensity/effort players are putting in. Higher pl per minute means they are most likely sprinting/exerting lots of energy which may take longer recovery.\n",
        "* ``Explosive Efforts``: Number of high-intensity movements. This is important because high intensity movements can cause strain on muscles leading to potential injuries.\n",
        "* ``Session Total Jump``: Total jumps in a session. This is important because positions that jump a lot may need more recovery due to the strain this puts on tendons. Especially since jumps are very frequent in basketball.\n",
        "* ``Session Jumps Per Minute``: Jumps per minute (jump intensity). This can identify positions that may be at risk for knee injury if they have a very high rate of jumps per minutes.\n",
        "* ``Total IMA``: Total number of movements (all intensities). This is important to analyze all movement and not just high intensity movement.\n",
        "* ``IMA/Min``: Number of movements per minute. This is important to track endurance by position.\n",
        "* ``Position``: This is important for our analysis to compare all of our variables against position. \n",
