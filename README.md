# DS2023 Catapult Group 2 Final Project
Alka Link, Grace Pitts, Kieran Perdue, and Michael Carlson

Our final project explores Catapult tracking data from the UVA men's basketball team to show how physical demands on players shift throughout the season. By combining data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and stakeholder knowledge, we were able to uncover that as player load per minute steadily declined, explosive efforts actually increased towards the end of the season. This allowed us to recommend targeting training strategies to help prepare the players for postseason games.

This project allowed us to practice the data science workflow process, from cleaning and preparing raw data to conducting exploratory analysis to building visuals and drawing conclusions. We were able to tell a compelling story with data that drives real-world decisions. This is pertinent to our careers in data science because it helped us turn a complex dataset into actionable insight. Through this project, we honed in on our story telling abilities and the ability to communicate effectively with non-technical audiences.
